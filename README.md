# RFM Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

This repository contains code and resources for segmenting customers based on their RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores using the K-means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a crucial task for businesses to understand their customer base and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. RFM analysis is a popular technique used in marketing analytics to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their transaction behavior.

## Overview

In this project, we leverage RFM analysis to assign each customer three scores: recency, frequency, and monetary value. We then apply the K-means clustering algorithm to these scores to segment customers into meaningful groups. K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique that partitions the data into K clusters based on similarity.

## Key Features

- **RFM Analysis**: Compute the recency, frequency, and monetary value scores for each customer based on their transaction history.
- **K-means Clustering**: Apply the K-means algorithm to segment customers into distinct clusters based on their RFM scores.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters and cluster centers to gain insights into customer segments.
- **Interpretation**: Interpret the results of customer segmentation and derive actionable insights for marketing and business strategies.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocess the transaction data and compute the RFM scores for each customer.
2. **K-means Clustering**: Apply the K-means algorithm to the RFM scores to segment customers into clusters.
3. **Visualization**: Visualize the clusters and cluster centers using scatter plots or other visualization techniques.
4. **Interpretation**: Interpret the results of customer segmentation and use them to inform marketing strategies and business decisions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

## Credits

This project is inspired by the RFM analysis technique commonly used in marketing analytics. The implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm is based on the scikit-learn library in Python.
